As a cricket enthusiast🏏, I took on a personal project to analyze the 2024 IPL match between RCB and DC. The game showcased a thrilling blend of batting, bowling, and partnerships, and I was curious to dive deeper into the data to better understand the strategies and pivotal moments that led to RCB’s win. 🤔 



My aim was to conduct a thorough analysis of the match to explore key factors such as run distribution, top performers, and bowling strategies. I also wanted to visualize how momentum shifted throughout the game and pinpoint the critical moments that influenced the outcome.



In this project, I focused on:

1)Run distribution per over to observe scoring trends and the pace of the game.

2)Top scorers from each team to highlight standout individual performances.

Bowling analysis and types of dismissals to see how bowlers influenced the match.

3)A phase-wise breakdown to understand how each team approached different phases of the innings.

4)Cumulative run rate comparison, which provided insight into the shifting momentum between RCB and DC.



Through this analysis, I discovered the following key insights 🧐 :

🏏 Strategic Batting & Aggressive Bowling: Both teams demonstrated a balance of strategic batting and aggressive bowling, but RCB’s ability to maintain a consistent run rate gave them a decisive edge.

🏏 Crucial Wicket-Taking Moments: RCB’s timely wickets at critical moments broke partnerships, applying sustained pressure on DC.

Higher Cumulative Run Rate: A higher run rate throughout the match allowed RCB to control the game's tempo and outpace DC.

🏏 Game-Altering Partnerships: Strong partnerships helped RCB recover quickly after losing wickets and regain momentum.

🏏 Phase-wise Analysis: The middle overs were a turning point for RCB, as their aggressive approach during this phase shifted the game in their favor.

😀 This personal project gave me a deeper appreciation for the complexity of T20 cricket and provided valuable insights into how momentum and tactical decisions shape the outcome of a match.
